# CoderDojo - Start Node - Create a social network

This is an introduction to server side programming in Node.js and was created for CoderDojo members. The aim of this session is to create a social network in 2 hours! which we can then launch and sell for billions 

## Step 1 Install Node

Install Node from http://nodejs.org

## Step 2 Setup the project

Create the project folder 

````
mkdir coderdojo-start-node
````

Now create a folder called __public__, this is the folder whereyou will add the html, css and javascript code

````
cd coderdojo-start-node
mkdir public
````

## Install express 

__npm__ is Node Package Manager allows you to install Node Packages, to run a web server we are going to use a node package called __express__ will enable us to create a server easily that can accept web requests.

Now run 

````
npm install express
````

## Turn it into a social website and Install socket.io 

Socket.io is a technology that allows browsers to easily communicate with the server over streams.  

Now run 

````
npm install socket.io
````

## Now lets create our Node.js file

Now in the home directory __coderdojo-start-node__ save a new file called __app.js__.  Inside app.js add the following code

````
var express = require('express');
var app = express();


var server = app.listen(3000, function() {
    console.log('Listening on port %d', server.address().port);
});

````
This code creates your first server and first http call

## Run your code

From inside directory __candy-v-fruit__ open a command terminal and run 

````
node app

````
We are running __app__ because the file is called __app.js__

You should see the following output from this command

````
$ node app
Listening on port 3000
````

This is tell you that a server has started on your machine at port __3000__ 

You can stop the server at any time by running ````CTRL+C````

## Open your browser

Navigate to 

````
http://localhost:3000
````
Now see what happens 

## We now need update app.js to read your html code from the public folder

Update app.js with the following code

````javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
var path = require('path');

var server = app.listen(3000, function() {
    console.log('Listening on port %d', server.address().port);
});

var io = require('socket.io')(server);


app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

app.get('/coderdojo', function(req, res){
  res.send('Be cool');
});

io.on('connection', function (socket) {
  console.log('emitting');
  socket.on('chat', function (data) {
  	console.log('emitting 2');
    console.log(data);
    socket.broadcast.emit('chat',  data);
  });
});
```` 

Now open your browser and navigate to

```` 
http://localhost:3000 
````
